## Java Packaging

- [Buildpacks](https://buildpacks.io/): Cloud Native Buildpacks
transform your application source code into images that can run on any cloud.
- [Paketo](https://paketo.io/): your app, in your favorite language, ready to run in the cloud
- [Dockerfile Maven](https://github.com/spotify/dockerfile-maven): integrates Maven with Docker.
- [dokcer-maven-plugin](https://github.com/fabric8io/docker-maven-plugin): 
- [Jib](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/jib): builds optimized Docker and OCI images for your Java applications without a Docker daemon - and without deep mastery of Docker best-practices. It is available as plugins for Maven and Gradle and as a Java library.

## Tools

- [Dive](https://github.com/wagoodman/dive): a tool for exploring a docker image, layer contents, and discovering ways to shrink the size of your Docker/OCI image.
- [Java Buildpack Memory Calculator](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/java-buildpack-memory-calculator): calculates a holistic JVM memory configuration with the goal of ensuring that applications perform well while not exceeding a container's memory limit and being recycled.
